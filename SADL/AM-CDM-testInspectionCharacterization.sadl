TestInspectionCharacterization (note "Any test, inspection, or characterization performed on any part or material specimen from any stage of the additive manufacturing fabrication process (excluding in-process monitoring).") is a type of ProcessStep,
	described by ticID (note "An identifier of the test, inspection or characterization type.") with a single value of type string,
	described by ticName (note "A short description of the test, inspection, or characterization.") with a single value of type string,
	described by ticType (note "Type of test/inspection/characterization, such as tensile test, fatigue test, etc.") with a single value of type TICType,
	described by ticSpecimen with a single value of type Specimen,
	described by ticLocation (note "The physical location where the test was conducted.") with a single value of type Address,
	described by ticNotes (note "Itemized descriptions of observations relating to the individual test, inspection, or characterization of an individual specimen.") with values of type string,
	described by ticSoftware (note "Identifier of any Software that was used during the test, inspection, or characterization.") with a single value of type Software,
	described by ticDestructiveVsNonDestructive (note "Indication of whether the test, inspection, or characterization irreversibly changed the nature of the specimen.") with a single value of type TestType,
	described by ticDuration (note "The time that the Test took (Test only).") with a single value of type Measurement,
	described by ticSpecification (note "The specification to use to run the test, inspection, or characterization. Note that ticSpecification should override processSpecification") with a single value of type TICSpecification,
	described by ticResult with a single value of type TestResult.

TICSpecification (note "A specification with the details necessary to perform a test, specification, or characterization.") is a type of ProcessSpecification,
	described by ticProcedure (note "The procedure used if it is not from an existing standard.") with a single value of type Document.

// TODO: Flesh out more common TICTypes
TICType is a class, must be one of {Tensile, Creep, Fatigue, Thermal}.

TestType is a class, must be one of {Destructive, NonDestructive}.

// Specific types of test results would inherit from this and include more specific result types.
TestResult is a class,
	described by isPedigreed (note "Declares whether or not the result data is pedigreed.") with a single value of type boolean,
	described by ticEnvironment (note "The measured environment in which the test was performed.") with a single value of type Environment,
	described by ticNotes (note "Observations recorded during the performance of the test.") with a single value of type string,
	described by ticPassFail (note "Indication of whether the results of the test, inspection, or characterization passed or failed and is for informational purposes only.") with a single value of type TICResultStatus,
	described by ticReport with a single value of type Document,
	described by ticMaterialProperty with values of type MaterialProperties.

TICResultStatus is a class, must be one of {Pass, Fail}.

Specimen (note "Information specific to an individual specimen. A specimen refers to the actual coupon used for a test, inspection, or characterization. One part may contain no specimens, one specimen, or multiple specimens. A part can also be the specimen without additional sectioning or post processing.") is a class,
	described by specimenID (note "The identifier of the individual specimen.") with a single value of type string,
	described by specimenDescription (note "A description of the specimen.") with a single value of type string,
	described by specimenMass with a single value of type Measurement,
	described by specimenProcessHistory (note "Events in chronological order that occurred to a specimen after it existed in the base geometric form as specified in the applicable standard. For example, surface preparations, mounting, dye penetrant application, etc.") with a single value of type ProcessHistory,
	described by specimenDeviations (note "Description of any differences from recommendations made in the standards for specimen configuration and preparation.") with values of type string.

PartSpecimen (note "A specimen that is extracted from a Part. Not to be confused with FeedstockSpecimen.") is a type of Specimen,
	described by specimenParentPart with a single value of type Part,
	described by specimenCoordinateOnBuild (note "The location of the box center of the part, or an accepted reference datum.") with a single value of type CartesianCoordinate,
	described by specimenOrientationA (note "The orientation defined in ISO 52921, in A, B, C of the minimal bounding box orientation.") with a single value of type Measurement,
	described by specimenOrientationB (note "The orientation defined in ISO 52921, in A, B, C of the minimal bounding box orientation.") with a single value of type Measurement,
	described by specimenOrientationC (note "The orientation defined in ISO 52921, in A, B, C of the minimal bounding box orientation.") with a single value of type Measurement,
	// In the future, we have a Design class with PartDesign, SpecimenDesign subclasses. Below should be of type SpecimenDesign rather than Document. Might also be common geometry terminology from standards.
	described by specimenGeometry (note "The geometry of the specimen.") with a single value of type Document.

FeedstockSpecimen (note "A specimen that is extracted from a Feedstock. Not to be confused with a PartSpecimen.") is a type of Specimen,
	described by specimenFeedstockSource with a single value of type Feedstock.
