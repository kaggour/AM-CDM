# Contributing to AM CDM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **AM Common Data Model (AM CDM)**.

This project is developed collaboratively by domain experts, researchers, and software practitioners. You **do not need to be a software developer or GitHub expert** to contribute.

We welcome questions, feedback, and proposed improvements.

---

## How this project works (high level)

To keep discussions productive and traceable, we separate contributions into two main paths:

- **Discussions** → questions, clarifications, and proposed ideas  
- **Issues** → concrete problems in the data model that should be resolved

If you are unsure which to use, **start with a Discussion**.

---

## Asking questions or requesting clarification

If something is unclear, ambiguous, or you want to better understand the intent of the model:

➡️ **Start a Q&A Discussion**

Examples:
- “What is the intended meaning of this attribute?”
- “How should this be interpreted in practice?”
- “Is this concept covered elsewhere in the model?”

Discussions are informal and exploratory. No solution proposal is required.

---

## Reporting a model issue or inconsistency

Use an **Issue** only when you believe there is a **specific problem** in the model.

Examples:
- Internal inconsistency
- Ambiguous or conflicting definitions
- Missing constraints
- Terminology conflicts

When opening an Issue, you will be asked to:
1. Describe the problem clearly
2. Explain why it matters
3. **Suggest a possible resolution**

The proposed resolution does **not** need to be final or correct — it simply helps frame the discussion.

This mirrors defect reporting practices used in many standards organizations.

---

## Proposing new features or extensions

If you have an idea for:
- A new concept
- An extension to the model
- A structural change

➡️ **Start an Extensions/Enhancement Discussion**

This allows the community to:
- Clarify scope
- Explore alternatives
- Build consensus

If there is agreement that a change should be made, a maintainer may open a formal Issue to track implementation.

---

## Do I need to use Git or submit code?

No.

Many contributions are:
- Conceptual
- Editorial
- Terminology-related
- Based on domain expertise

You are welcome to contribute entirely through Discussions and Issues.

Pull requests are optional and not expected from most contributors.

---

## Tone and expectations

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent
- Disagreement is normal and expected in standards work

We value clarity, traceability, and collaboration over speed.

---

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to follow the project’s Code of Conduct.
Please help us maintain a welcoming and professional environment.

---

## Getting help

If you are new to GitHub or unsure how to proceed:
- Start a Discussion
- Or open a Question asking for guidance

We are happy to help.
