# Governance

This document describes how the AM Common Data Model (AM CDM) project is
maintained and how decisions are made.

The goal is to provide clarity and transparency while keeping the process
lightweight and accessible.

---

## Project scope

The AM CDM repository contains a community-developed data model intended to
support interoperability and shared understanding in additive manufacturing.

This project is experimental and evolving. Participation does not imply
endorsement by any individual or organization.

---

## Roles

### Contributors
Anyone may participate by:
- Starting Discussions
- Reporting issues
- Proposing changes
- Submitting pull requests (optional)

Contributors do not need to be software developers.

---

### Editors
Editors are responsible for:
- Reviewing pull requests
- Managing issues
- Facilitating discussions
- Maintaining consistency of the model

Editors are identified via the repository’s CODEOWNERS file.

---

### Maintainers / Owners
A small group of maintainers (or owners) manage:
- Repository settings
- Releases
- Governance updates

This group may include representatives from multiple institutions.

---

## Decision making

The project follows a consensus-oriented approach:

1. **Questions, clarifications, and proposals** should begin as Discussions.
2. **Model issues or inconsistencies** are tracked as GitHub Issues.
3. Editors seek consensus where possible.
4. If consensus cannot be reached, editors may make a decision based on:
   - Technical coherence
   - Project scope
   - Community feedback

Decisions and their rationale should be documented in Issues or Discussions.

---

## Changes to the model

- All changes to the model must be made via pull request.
- Pull requests require review and approval as defined by branch protection
  rules and CODEOWNERS.
- Significant or breaking changes should reference an Issue or Discussion.

---

## Neutrality and participation

The AM CDM project is intended to be neutral and community-driven.

Participation by any organization (including government, academic, or industry
institutions) does not imply ownership, control, or endorsement of the project
or its outputs.

---

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to follow the project’s Code of Conduct.

---

## Amendments

This governance document may be updated as the project evolves.
